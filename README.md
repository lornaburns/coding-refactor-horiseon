TITLE: Coding Refactor for Horiseon Webpage

DESCRIPTION: 
The primary goal of this application was to improve accessibility for this webpage. Alternate text was
added for all images and icons. 

Basic consolidation was also performed, reducing redundancies in the code. Comments were made in the stylesheet to label categories as well as explain any changes made in that category. 

Semantic elements were substituted for HTML elements to improve readability.

A descriptive title was provided.

INSTRUCTIONS: Upload index.html and assets folder to web browser. Assets folder contains stylesheet and images.
